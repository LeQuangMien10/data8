    "\n",
    "> We will draw randomly with replacement from a simplified 13 card deck with 4 face cards (A, J, Q, K), and 9 numbered cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). If we draw cards with replacement 13 times, and if the number of face cards is greater than or equal to 4, we lose.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Otherwise, Jade loses.\n",

    "We play the game once and we lose, observing 8 total face cards. We are angry and accuse Jade of cheating! Jade is adamant, however, that the deck is fair.\n",

    "Jade's model claims that there is an equal chance of getting any of the cards (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K), but we do not believe her. We believe that the deck is clearly rigged, with face cards (A, J, Q, K) being more likely than the numbered cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)."
